                    <p>My first experience with computers was way back in the day, when Windows XP
                        was still the best OS you could have and I remember playing old racing games
                        with my father and my uncle, as well as learning how to pirate those games off
                        shady websites(I know that's not good, but I'm from

                        and then having to fix my mistakes every time because there was alot that could
                        go wrong. That was when I actually started having an intresty in how programs
                        work and how they are made.

                    <p>I came to
                        <a href="hz.nl" target="_blank">Hz University of Applied Sciences</a>, to learn
                        more about programming and aqquire the skills to be a Software Engineer in the
                        future. I hope that someday I will be good enough in the field to make my own
