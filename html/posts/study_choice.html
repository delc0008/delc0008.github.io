                <h3>I've always been intrested in computers.</h3>
                <br>
                <p>Since I was a young slavic boy, i've always liked computers, programs and games and how they worked, especially why they worked the way they did.<br>
                So in Highschool, I entered into a programming class where I learned more about code and the machine we call a computer.<br>
                I explored different programming languages in the likes of C++ and C#(also MySQL but I am not confident at that one at all).<br>
                In 2023 I decided to do Civil Engineering, and oh lord how big of a mistake that was, that was because it was close to Architecture and Most of us should know the<br> "How I Met Your Mother" TV show
                and about "Ted Mosby", it just made me want to be a cool Architect. <br>
                And then I realised Engineering wasn't for me and I went back to where I should be which is ICT.<br>
                In my opinion I've made the right choice by chosing ICT in HZ because it is also one of the best programs in the Netherlands in the field of Tech.</p>
